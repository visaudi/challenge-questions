# JavaScript
## First
* Make an add function in JavaScript

## Callbacks
* Take an add function which takes two arguments.
* The first argument is a function.
* The second argument is an array of numbers.
* The function argument is called with the sum of the array of numbers.

## Closures
* A function which returns an object with methods.
* The function takes an array of numbers.
* The object's methods are .total and .add.
* .total gives the total sum of all numbers added.
* .add adds more numbers to the total stored behind the closure.
* This one is hard. Don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions.
